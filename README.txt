Introduction
============

Plone theme based on Twitter Bootstrap 2.0


Installation
============

Install like normal diazo themes. We recommend disabling public.css as
this theme includes a cleaned up version of public.css.

You can disable it by activating diazotheme.bootstrap in the Add-On setup 
page in Site Setup, or you can go to http://$site/portal_css/manage_workspace
and uncheck public.css
